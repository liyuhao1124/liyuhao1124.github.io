I am a senior undergraduate at EECS, Peking University, where I have the great fortune of being advised by Prof. Xiaotie Deng. From the summer of 2020, I am also very fortunate to work with Prof. Xi Chen.

I am interested broadly in theoretical computer science, and I have been working on algorithmic game theory and computational complexity.

I am applying for Fall 2021 PhD.

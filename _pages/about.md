I am a senior undergraduate at EECS, Peking University, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm). From the summer of 2020, I am also very fortunate to work with Prof. [Xi Chen](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~xichen/Homepage/Welcome.html).

My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, and I have been working on algorithmic game theory and computational complexity.

**I am applying for Fall 2021 PhD.**
